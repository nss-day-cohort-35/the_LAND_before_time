                    <p>Starting at a young age Amy would always mess around on her brother's (Alex) guitar, until the
                        age of 14 when she decided to buy her own. She starting chasing music a year later. She started
                        with a group called the 'Bolsha Band', but worked as an entertainment journalist for World
                        Entertainment News Network, in addition to singing for her group. Then in July 2000 she became a
                        featured vocalist for the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Amys bestfirend, soul signer Tyler
                        James then sent a demo tape Amys to some talent scouts. Darcus Beese, a talent scout for Island,
                        heard of Amy by accident when the manager of Lewinson Brothers showed him some of Amy's work.
                        Although he wasnt able to find out who she was from Beese, and it took several months of
                        searching around to find out who this extrodinary talent was. </p>
