                    <p>Born in London, England, on September 14, 1983. Amy started messign around with music at a young
                        age, playing on her brothers guitar. When she turned 14 she bought her own and started playing
                        music. She starting chasing music a year later. She started
                        with a group called the 'Bolsha Band', but worked as an entertainment journalist for World
                        Entertainment News Network, in addition to singing for her group. Then in July 2000 she became a
                        featured vocalist for the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Amys bestfirend, soul signer Tyler
                        James then sent a demo tape Amys to some talent scouts. Darcus Beese, a talent scout for Island,
                        heard of Amy by accident when the manager of Lewinson Brothers showed him some of Amy's work.
                        Although he wasnt able to find out who she was from Beese, and it took several months of
                        searching around to find out who this extrodinary talent was. </p>

                    <p>On October 20th, 2003, Amy's debut album Frank was released. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many
                        songs were influenced by jazzy type music and , apart from two songs, Winehouse co-wrote every
                        song. Then in 2004 her album hit upper charts, and got nominated for the Britsh Awards for
                        "Britsh Female Solo Artist" and "Britsh Urban Act." Frank would eventually hit platnium sales.
                        In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as "You Know I'm No Good" and "Rehab" appeared on Mark
                        Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. They were some of her first songs to appear
                        on the radio after the release of "Pumps" and both expected to be on her next album. Promotion
                        of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was
                        relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. "Back to Black" was
                        released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two
                        weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it
                        entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007,
                        selling 1.85 million copies over the course of the year. The album had multiple hit songs such
                        as "Rehab" and went #1 on the UK billboards in early 2007.

                    <p>Its no secret that Amy has struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. Her husband, Blake
                        Feilder-Civil, said himself that he is the reason she started doing drugs and drinking heavily.
                        Like most A-list celeberties battling addiction, it was no easy task to stop.
                        She did try and go to rehab and had gotten sober for months before her first relapes.
                        They would end up getting a divorce with the help of Amy's fathe, who ended up forging her
                        signiture on the divorce papers, as he and blake decided it was in the best intrest of her rehab
                        to seperate. Amy would later go on to say she went months before even knowing they were
                        divorced. Alochol was what in the long run ended things for this superstar. On July 23rd 2011,
                        Amy was found dead in her house due to an apperant accidental overdose. Her B.A.C (Blood Alcohol
                        Content) was at a .416 and she had two largre empty vodka bottles in her room.
