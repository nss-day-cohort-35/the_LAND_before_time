                <h2>Who was she?</h2>
                <p class="living-date">1983 - 2011</p>
                <p>Born in London, England, on September 14, 1983, Amy Jade Winehouse broke into the music 
                    business when, at age 16, a classmate passed on her demo tape to a record label. 
                    She signed her first record deal as a jazz vocalist, and her music later blossomed 
                    into an eclectic mix of jazz, pop, soul and R&B. Winehouse won five Grammy Awards 
                    connected to her 2006 album Back to Black, and earned acclaim for songs like the 
                    title track, "Rehab" and "Love Is a Losing Game." Winehouse died tragically on July 
                    23, 2011, at the age of 27 from accidental alcohol poisoning.</p>

                <p><strong> Prince - "Love is a Losing Game"</strong></p>
                <p class="collab-text">It can’t be easy to collaborate with Prince. First of all, he might be the greatest 
                    rock musician of all time (go listen to Dirty Mind, don’t even try to disagree.) 
                    He’s also a notoriously difficult individual who plays huge stadiums, so getting 
                    up on stage and playing one of your own songs with him is probably intimidating. 
                    You can hear some of that in Winehouse’s voice at the start of ‘Love Is A Losing 
                    Game’, but she’s over it pretty quickly, bringing a soft touch to the diminutive 
                    genius’ brash arrangement. When she leaves the stage, Prince tells the crowd, ”I 
                    got tears… I’m gonna have to get my shades on.” Amy Winehouse made Prince cry. 
                    Muse on that for a while.</p>

                <p><strong>Mark Ronson - "Valerie"</strong></p>
                <p class="collab-text">Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson made six songs on her sophomore LP including “Rehab” & 
                    “Back to Black.” The producer said that Winehouse came up with the refrain for 
                    “Rehab” while they were walking together and she was recalling her past battles with 
                    drugs. Ronson won two Grammy Awards for his work with Winehouse, earning Record of the Year 
                    for “Rehab” and Best Pop Vocal Album for Back to Black. He also won Producer of the 
                    Year, Non-Classical that same year, in part for his work with her. After her passing, 
                    Ronson contributed to AMY, Asif Kapadia’s 2015 film about the singer that won the 
                    Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</p>

                <p><strong>Nas - "Cherry Wine"</strong></p>
                <p class="collab-text">Winehouse had already dedicated a song to Nas before meeting the Queens rapper. The 
                    slow swing of Back to Black‘s ‘Me and Mr Jones’ got the two of them talking and 
                    eventually led to two solid collaborations: ‘Cherry Wine’ and ‘Little Smoke’. Both 
                    tracks hold up well, but ‘Like Smoke’ is the superior track. Nas is on much better 
                    form, Winehouse’s vocals are given relatively free reign and, most importantly, the 
                    track has the feel of a genuine collaboration rather than a decent remix.</p>
