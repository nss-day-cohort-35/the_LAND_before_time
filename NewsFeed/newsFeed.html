        <p>February 22, 2019. London. The company developing an Amy Winehouse hologram tour has postponed the project.
            Base Hologram said in a statement that it had encountered “some unique challenges and sensitivities”
            on the path to “remembering Amy Winehouse and her legacy in the most celebratory and respectful way
            possible”.
            “Consent for holograms is going to be a hot topic,” Catherine Allen, founder of the arts venue virtual
            reality platform
            Limina Immersive and an expert on VR and its ethics, told the Guardian last year. “As long as the person
            has
            consented it’s fine.
            And this is where it gets tricky with Amy.”

        <p>Many critics feel that Amy Winehouse is being exploited posthumously by her family.  
            The family were heavily criticized during Amy's lifetime for contributing to her downfall.

        <h2>The Impossible Task of Keeping Amy Winehouse Alive, 8 Years After Her Death</h2>

        <p>July 23rd, 2019, London. She is not the first legend this has happened to.
            Eventually, all musicians who die too soon fall prey to the public's desire to mythologize them,
            but the process reduces them to their most memorable selves;
            shells devoid of the complexities that made them great in the first place.
            What we're left with is Jimi Hendrix kneeling before a flaming guitar; Kurt Cobain in blue flannel,
            crying at the side of the stage; John Lennon, naked and fetal, clinging to Yoko.

        <p>July 23rd, 2019, London.  “I’m not a natural born performer. I’m a natural singer, but I’m quite shy, really,” she said.
            “You know what it’s like? I don’t mean to be sentimental or soppy but it’s a little bit like being in
            love,
            when you can’t eat, you’re restless, it’s like that. “But then the minute you go on stage, everything’s
            OK.
            The minute you start singing.”

            March 12, 2019, East London.  Amy’s Place is one of small number of organisations in the UK trying to reintegrate young women into
            society
            after
            they have completed treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
            The centre offers 16 women aged between 18 and 30 a temporary home where they can continue to recover
            and
            learn the
            skills they need to re-adapt to society. Amy’s Place was announced as one of five winners at the Centre
            for
            Social Justice (CSJ) Awards,
            handed out each year to honour the best grassroots charities and social enterprises across the country.
