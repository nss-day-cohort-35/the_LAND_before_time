    <p>The company developing an Amy Winehouse hologram tour has postponed the project. 
        Base Hologram said in a statement that it had encountered “some unique challenges and sensitivities” 
        on the path to “remembering Amy Winehouse and her legacy in the most celebratory and respectful way possible”.
        “Consent for holograms is going to be a hot topic,” Catherine Allen, founder of the arts venue virtual reality platform 
        Limina Immersive and an expert on VR and its ethics, told the Guardian last year. “As long as the person has consented it’s fine. 
        And this is where it gets tricky with Amy.”

        <p>Many critics feel that Amy Winehouse is being exploited posthumously by a family whose
            exploitation was a catalyst in her downfall while she was still alive. </p>

        <p>She is not the first legend this has happened to. 
            Eventually, all musicians who die too soon fall prey to the public's desire to mythologize them, 
            but the process reduces them to their most memorable selves; 
            shells devoid of the complexities that made them great in the first place. 
            What we're left with is Jimi Hendrix kneeling before a flaming guitar; Kurt Cobain in blue flannel, 
            crying at the side of the stage; John Lennon, naked and fetal, clinging to Yoko.

        <p>“I’m not a natural born performer. I’m a natural singer, but I’m quite shy, really,” she said.
            “You know what it’s like? I don’t mean to be sentimental or soppy but it’s a little bit like being in love, 
            when you can’t eat, you’re restless, it’s like that. “But then the minute you go on stage, everything’s OK. 
            The minute you start singing.”

            Amy’s Place is one of small number of organisations in the UK trying to reintegrate young women into society after 
            they have completed treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
            The centre offers 16 women aged between 18 and 30 a temporary home where they can continue to recover and learn the 
            skills they need to re-adapt to society. Amy’s Place was announced as one of five winners at the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) Awards, 
            handed out each year to honour the best grassroots charities and social enterprises across the country. </p>
